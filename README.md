# SeeSharpWebshop

A simple webshop made in .Net C# MVC and Web API. Using a SQLite database to make it easier to test, but can be switched for whatever reason. Also Bootstrap is easy and CSS is hard.

## Install
1. Download or clone to some folder.
2. Open .sln(solution) with favorite IED(or IDE).
3. Run and hope it works I guess?

## Testers
none so far...
